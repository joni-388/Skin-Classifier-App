# OOD_2_share
Skin Classifier App which is based on the Kaggle [HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) Dataset.
The app can classify an uploaded image in the classes shown in the table below. Moreover, Monte Carlo Dropout can be added to enhance the prediction. In addition to that, also a out of distribution detection based on Mahalanobis distance is implemented. The OOD is based on the paper [Distance-based detection of out-of-distribution silent failures for Covid-19 lung lesion segmentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522002298) from Camila Gonz√°lez et al.

### App
You can finde the implementation of the app in the folder APP SKin Classfier. The App uses a saved model which is generated by the notebook. With the backup file a conda environment can be created which can execute the app via `main.py`

### Data Script

The preprocessing, training, validation, Monte Carlo dropout, OOD, etc. can be found in the jupyter notebook OOD2 which can be run with collab. However, the Datasets (HAM10000) must be downloaded and placed in the google drive.
